# Ex.No:5(C)  FILE HANDLING USING JAVA
## QUESTION:
Write a program to write multiple lines to a file using FileWriter.

For example:

Input	Result
Hello world
Welcome to Java
exit
File written successfully to multilines.txt


## AIM:

To write a Java program that reads multiple lines from the user and writes them to a file using FileWriter.
## ALGORITHM :
1. Create a Scanner to read input from the user.

2. Create a FileWriter object for the file multilines.txt.

3. Use a loop to read each line from the user.

4. If the line is "exit", break the loop.

5. Otherwise, write the line to the file followed by a newline.

6. Close the FileWriter.

7. Print a message indicating the file has been written successfully.

                if (line.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) break;
                writer.write(line + System.lineSeparator());
            }
            writer.close();
            System.out.println("File written successfully to multilines.txt");
